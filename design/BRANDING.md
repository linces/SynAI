# 🎨 SynAI Visual Identity System (v1.0)

**Concept:** "The Neural Lattice"
SynAI is not just code; it's the connective tissue between artificial intelligences. The brand should feel **Technical, Sovereign, and Connective**.

## 1. Core Palette (Cyber-Industrial)

We use a high-contrast dark theme optimized for developer comfort and futuristic appeal.

| Color Name        | Hex Code  | Usage                             |
| :---------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **Void Black**    | `#0f172a` | Main Background (Deep & Clean)    |
| **Synapse Blue**  | `#3b82f6` | Primary Action / Connection Lines |
| **Electric Cyan** | `#06b6d4` | Highlights / Active States        |
| **Signal Purple** | `#8b5cf6` | Cognitive Events / "Thinking"     |
| **Alert Amber**   | `#f59e0b` | Warnings / Latency                |
| **Code Gray**     | `#64748b` | Subtitles / Inactive text         |

## 2. Typography

A pairing that blends human readability with machine precision.

- **Headings:** `Inter` (Bold, Tracking -1%) - Clean, modern, universally readable.
- **Code / Mono:** `JetBrains Mono` or `Fira Code` - The developer's native tongue.

## 3. Logo Concept: "The Synapse Node"

- **Symbol:** An abstract hexagon or circle with three converging lines meeting at a central glowing node. Represents the "Handshake" between three entities (User, Agent, Tool).
- **Style:** Minimalist, flat-vector mixed with a subtle neon glow (for dark mode).
- **Wordmark:** "Syn**AI**" where "Syn" is thinner (light weight) and "AI" is bolder (bold weight), emphasizing the Artificial Intelligence core.

## 4. UI Design Language: "Glass & Grid"

- **Glassmorphism:** Subtle background blurs (`backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`) for floating panels (Command Center).
- **Grid Backgrounds:** Very faint hexagonal or square grids on the background to imply structure.
- **Motion:** Transitions should be instant (0.1s - 0.2s) or "snappy". No slow fades.
